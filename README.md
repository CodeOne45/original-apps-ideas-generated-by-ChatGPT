# Apps

## "Time Capsule"

A reactjs app that allows users to create and share "time capsules" of photos, videos, and other media from specific moments in their lives. Users could choose to set the capsules to be unlocked and viewable at a specific time in the future, or they could allow others to access the capsules immediately. The app could also include features like automatic notifications when a capsule is about to be unlocked, the ability to add notes or messages to capsules, and the option to keep capsules private or make them viewable to certain people or groups. This app could be sold on a subscription basis or through in-app purchases.


## "Telepath Connect"

A reactjs app that allows users to communicate telepathically with one another using their phones or other devices. The app could use a combination of brainwave scanning technology and machine learning algorithms to translate users' thoughts into text or audio messages that can be transmitted to other users. This app could be especially useful for people with disabilities that prevent them from speaking or writing easily, as well as for people who want a more efficient and private way to communicate. The app could be sold on a subscription basis or through in-app purchases.

## "AI Rights Monitor"

A reactjs app that allows users to track and advocate for the rights and treatment of artificial intelligences and other intelligent machines. The app could include a database of laws and regulations related to AI and robotics, as well as news and information about AI-related issues and events. Users could also use the app to report instances of abuse or mistreatment of AIs and to get involved in efforts to protect and improve the rights of these beings. This app could be particularly relevant and timely given the increasing reliance on and development of AI in various industries.

## "TimeScape"

A reactjs app that allows users to explore and experience different time periods in virtual reality. Using historical data and artificial intelligence, the app could generate detailed, realistic simulations of what it would be like to live in a specific time and place in the past or future. Users could choose from a variety of time periods and locations, or even create their own custom scenarios. The app could be used for education, entertainment, and even as a tool for historians and researchers to test and explore different historical hypotheses. TimeScape could also be monetized through in-app purchases or subscriptions.

## "Bokanovsky Match"

A reactjs app that uses DNA analysis and machine learning to help people find their ideal reproductive partner. Users could input their own DNA data and specify their desired traits in a partner (e.g. intelligence, physical attractiveness, temperament, etc.). The app would then use this information to search its database of other users and identify potential matches based on the likelihood of producing offspring with the desired traits. This app could be especially useful for people who are looking to have children but want to increase the chances of producing offspring with certain inherited characteristics.

## "Time Travel Planner" 

A reactjs app that helps users plan and book vacations to different time periods. The app could use historical data and simulations to give users an idea of what it would be like to visit a particular time and place, and help them make informed decisions about where and when to go. The app could also provide practical information about things like currency exchange, transportation, and accommodation. To make the app more feasible, the time travel aspect could be fictionalized and used as a marketing gimmick, rather than being presented as a genuine possibility. The app could be monetized through advertising and commissions from travel bookings.
